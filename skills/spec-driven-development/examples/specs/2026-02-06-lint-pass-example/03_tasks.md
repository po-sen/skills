# Task Plan

## Mode decision

- Selected mode: Full / Full
- Rationale:
- Upstream dependencies (`depends_on`): [] / list of `YYYY-MM-DD-slug`
- Dependency gate before `READY`: every dependency is folder-wide `status: DONE`
- If `02_design.md` is skipped (Quick mode):
  - Why it is safe to skip:
  - What would trigger switching to Full mode:
- If `04_test_plan.md` is skipped:
  - Where validation is specified (must be in each task):
